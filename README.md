> **"Life is linear, until it's not."**
> A comprehensive collection of study notes, summaries, and cheat sheets based on Professor Gilbert Strang's renowned curriculum.

## 📖 About The Project

This repository serves as a personal archive and a "cheat sheet" for Linear Algebra. It is designed to distill complex mathematical concepts into concise, readable Markdown documents.

The content primarily follows the flow of **Gilbert Strang's "Introduction to Linear Algebra"** and his MIT OpenCourseWare lectures, enriched with additional insights for practical application in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.

### Key Features
* **Concise Summaries:** Core concepts condensed for quick review.
* **Math-Heavy:** Extensive use of LaTeX for precise mathematical notation.
* **Cheat Sheets:** Quick reference guides for formulas, theorems, and matrix properties.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

The notes are organized to bridge the gap between pure mathematics and computational application:

- [x] **Vectors & Matrices**: Linear combinations, Dot products.
- [x] **Solving Linear Equations**: $Ax = b$, Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition.
- [x] **Vector Spaces**: Nullspace, Column space, Rank, Dimension.
- [x] **Orthogonality**: Projections, Least Squares, Gram-Schmidt.
- [x] **Determinants**: Properties and formulas (Cramer's Rule).
- [x] **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**: Diagonalization, Differential equations.
- [x] **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: The pinnacle of linear algebra for data science.
